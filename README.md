This repository contains an **unofficial** Go SDK for interacting with the [Bold](https://bold.co/) payment gateway API.

## Translations üåê

[English](README.md) | [Espa√±ol](docs/i18n/es/README.md)

## Features ‚ú®

### Payment Links API üí∏

Programmatically generate payment links for e-commerce and SaaS platforms, enabling secure and efficient online transactions.

- [x] Retrieve available payment methods ‚úÖ
- [x] Create payment link ‚úÖ
- [x] Retrieve payment link ‚úÖ

### Integrations API üîå

Facilitates direct communication between applications and Bold payment terminals (point-of-sale devices), automating the checkout process without manual intervention.

- [x] Retrieve available payment methods ‚úÖ (Beta, **not fully tested**)
- [x] Retrieve available payment terminals (POS devices) ‚úÖ (Beta, **not fully tested**)
- [ ] Create ‚ùå

Please note that the **integrations API is currently in beta**, which means it may undergo changes. Likewise, the implementation in this repository for interacting with the integrations API is also in beta, as testing these endpoints requires a physical payment terminal. **The current implementation is based solely on the examples provided in the official documentation, and full testing has not been possible due to the lack of access to a physical device.**

## Installation üì¶

Install the SDK like any other Go package:

```bash
go get github.com/PChaparro/bold-co-sdk
```

## Usage üöÄ

Refer to the integration tests to learn how to use the SDK. The available tests by functionality are:

Below is an example of generating a payment link:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"time"

	"github.com/PChaparro/bold-co-sdk/src/definitions"
	"github.com/PChaparro/bold-co-sdk/src/sdk"
)

func main() {
	// Load the API key from environment variables
	apiKey := os.Getenv("BOLD_API_KEY")
	if apiKey == "" {
		fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "Missing BOLD_API_KEY environment variable")
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	client := sdk.NewClient(sdk.ClientConfig{
		ApiKey: apiKey,
	})

	// Set the payment link expiration date
	expiration := time.Now().Add(24 * time.Hour).UnixNano()

	// Create the payment link request
	paymentLinkRequest := definitions.CreatePaymentLinkRequest{
		AmountType: definitions.AmountTypeClose,
		Amount: &definitions.Amount{
			Currency: definitions.CurrencyTypeCOP,
			Taxes: []definitions.Tax{
				{
					Type:  definitions.TaxTypeIVA,
					Base:  8403,
					Value: 1597,
				},
			},
			TipAmount:   0,
			TotalAmount: 10000,
		},
		PaymentMethods: []definitions.PaymentMethod{
			definitions.PaymentMethodPse,
		},
		Description:    "Description of product or service",
		PayerEmail:     "johndoe@example.com",
		ImageURL:       "https://robohash.org/sad.png",
		ExpirationDate: expiration,
		CallbackURL:    "https://example.com/callback",
	}

	ctx := context.Background()
	response, err := client.CreatePaymentLink(ctx, paymentLinkRequest)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error creating payment link: %v\n", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	// Print the payment link
	fmt.Printf("Payment link created successfully: %+v\n", response)
}
```

## Running Tests üß™

Ensure the `BOLD_API_KEY` environment variable is set with your Bold API key:

```bash
export BOLD_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

We recommend using your sandbox API key to avoid executing real transactions in production.

Run the integration tests:

```bash
go test -v ./src/sdk/...
```

To generate a test coverage report:

```bash
# Generate coverage report
go test -coverpkg=./src/sdk/... -coverprofile=./coverage/coverage.out ./src/sdk/...
# Open coverage report in HTML
go tool cover -html=./coverage/coverage.out
```
